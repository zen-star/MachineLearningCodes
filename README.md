# MachineLearningCodes
*This repository is created on Thur Nov 8 2018*

Codes here are all about machine learning, maybe mapreduce. 
> I'm a graduate student majoring in EE, but enthusiastic about coding & ml. 
  Here I implement algorithms I learned about ml, and try to make them easily useful.

1. MLshida.svm_r:
    
    __SVM_Regression_Zhengqi.py__: 
    main codes. 
    It is a SVM train & parameter optimal framework based on libsvm.
    Libsvm is not fully support Python3, so I modified a little to make it good in Python3.
    The code has successfully run on data from Zhengqi Prediction Competition of Ali Tianchi

    zhengqi_train.txt and zhengqi_test.txt are the original datasets. Details can be found at
    https://tianchi.aliyun.com/competition/
 

2. MLshida.mlutil.py
    
    there are some useful tools(io, pickle, etc.) for data operating.
